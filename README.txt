This project includes four separate folders, each to be run individually via the Main.m program (one of these exists in each folder).

The pdf write-up describes the differences between each folder's code implementation.

The folder that's titled "Vary one player wo Dom Strategy Reduction" holds only the dominating strategy algorithm that I implemented. Where as the folder titled "Vary one player w Dom Strategy Reduction" combines the new algorithm that I implemented with the work done by last year's project team (to remove the dominating strategies from the resource matrix array)
